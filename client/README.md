## Client Side

To run the program, you need to have internet connection because jQuery is embedded using CDN.

It's also better if you have live-server installed globally in your computer. So, every change that wanna do in this program can bee seen directly inside your terminal.

## Setup
The following task runner need to be installed in your computer:
- NodeJs

```
# installed live-server globally

> npm i -g live-server
```

After all those stuff are available in your computer. You can start to type `> live-server` in your CLI.
